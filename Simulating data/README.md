# Simulation studies

In this example I will be showing how to check the accuracy of the model given some simulated data. If you want to get an idea of how well this method will work on a given scenario then keep on reading. In short this model will work well when the coalescence times between ingroup/outgroup and ingroup/archaic are very different and recombination hasn't yet had time to break the segments into too small pieces. 

The separation of coalescence times between ingroup/outgroup and ingroup/archaic depends on many factors, number of individuals in the outgroup you have, effective population size in the common ancestor of ingroup/outgroup, population structure and bottlenecks. 

As I say in the paper:

> We note that this method will likely only work in cases where the coalescence time distribution of the ingroup and archaic segments are 
> sufficiently different. This will work better in cases where the variation in the ingroup is a subset of variation in the outgroup so the 
> majority of variation in the common ancestor can be removed, as the case of Non-Africans and Africans.
