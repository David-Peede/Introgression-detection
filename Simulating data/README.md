# Simulation studies

In this example I will be showing how to check the accuracy of the model given some simulated data. If you want to get an idea of how well this method will work on a given scenario then keep on reading. 

As I say in the paper (Skov et al 2018):
> We note that this method will likely only work in cases where the coalescence time distribution of the ingroup and archaic segments are

The separation of coalescence times between ingroup/outgroup and ingroup/archaic depends on many factors, number of individuals in the outgroup you have, effective population size in the common ancestor of ingroup/outgroup, population structure and bottlenecks. 
Furthermore the model will work better for more recent introgression events, because recombination hasn't yet had time to break down the segments into pieces that are so small they cannot be detected.
